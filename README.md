# micronn
A "micro" neural network framework with basic functionality for building and training simple networks.

Includes a demo of micro nn functionality using the classic MNIST dataset to construct a simple multi-class classification neural network with a train/test accuracy of 94.08%/93.25% achieved. Demo uses cross entropy loss and stoachastic gradient descent for training.
