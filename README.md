# micronn
A "micro" neural network framework with basic functionality for building and training simple networks like you would find in mainstream libraries such as pytorch and tensorflow.

Includes a quick applied demo featuring the classic MNIST dataset where micronn is used to construct a simple multi-class classification neural network with a train/test accuracy of 94.08%/93.25% achieved. Demo uses cross entropy loss and stochastic gradient descent for training.
